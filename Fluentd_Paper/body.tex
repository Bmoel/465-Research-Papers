\section{Introduction} \label{sec: intro}
\quad \quad With all of the different types of data that can come from all types of sources, it is necessary
nowadays to have a unified logging layer to sort and export all these different data sources. On the market some
of the tools that can accomplish this tend to be on the expensive side, but there are also open source tools that
work to compete with these tools. One such tool is Fluentd, which is an unified logging layer that is comparable to
Logstash, another popular logging tool. Both of these tools can be connected to Kibana and the Elastic Stack, 
making them powerful logging tools when used correctly. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The 
\hyperref[sec:motiv]{next section} gives the motivation as to why logging tools are important. 
\hyperref[sec:comp]{Section 3} gives a comparison between the two popular logging layer tools, Logstash and Fluentd,
as well as discuss how both connect the the ELK Stack. \hyperref[sec:demo]{Section 4} will give a demo on how to 
utilize Fluentd in different logging scenarios, and then \hyperref[sec:conclude]{section 6} will conclude the
paper.
